### Basic Usage
| Command | Response | Notes
| ------- | -------- | ---- |
| Help | Shows available commands | |
| Kpi | Shows some buttons with Measures from the master items. At the end, the Bot will show an Analysis button with access to the app in the Qlik Sense Hub. | This is a way to show a quick access to the most used measures. And to jump to the hub to have all the analytic capabilities from Qlik Sense. The last used measures will appear first. |
| Kpi &lt;measure&gt; | Shows the value of measure | Current filters are applied. Geo The Bot will filter the data based on the user location. It works, but it needs special configuration parameters. Work in progress to be easier. | 
| Reports | Shows all available NPrinting reports to the user. Then the user will be able to download any of them, and open it directly in Telegram. | The Bot will show all the PDF files available in the Report folder. |
| Dimensions | Shows with buttons all the dimensions included in master items. When one of them is selected, the Bot sends a message with an analysis of the dimension by the last measure used. | The Bot maintains the context during the conversation, and uses the last measure asked. |
| Measures | Shows with buttons all the measures included in master items. When one of them is selected, the Bot sends a message with its value. | It shows the total value for this measure, with no filters. Change App The Bot shows the applications published in the Qlik Sense Streams defined in the config file. When the user selects one app, the Bot will close the current one and open the new one. Every user could be connected to different apps. |
| Language | The Bot will show buttons for the user to select the desired language to receive the Bot messages. | If any user changes the language, at this moment it will be changed for all users. |
| English | The language is changed to English |
| Español | The language is changed to Spanish |
| Português | The language is changed to Portuguese |
| Italiano | The language is changed to Italian |

## Tips on modifying QlikSense chatbot
* Make telegram chatbot smarter
	* You will need to make several modification
		* BotOnMessageReceived (QlikSenseBot.cs line 513)
			* Taking care of messages received from telegram
		* ProcessConversationResponse (QlikSenseBot.cs line 852)
			* Decide what to do with response from ConversationService
		* BotOnCallbackQueryReceived (QlikSenseBot.cs line 979)
			* Taking care of call back query from telegram
		* Conversation.cs 
			* General Qlik sense related operations
		* New NLP service
			* This is relatively easier, you just need to create your NLP helper class and modify QlikNLP.cs to use it.
* Making a chatbot for slack
	* You will need to create a QlikSlackBot to replace QlikSenseBot 
	* You will need to rewrite user management functions in ConversationService

## Refactoring (In progress)
	
* The chatbot is also undergoing a process of reconstruction, the objective of refactoring is to
	* Enhance code reusability
	* Enhance readability
	* Enhance scalability
	* Enhance maintainability
	* More reliable
	* Estimated day of completion
		* It is an ongoing project so there is no fixed deadline
